# MiniProject01-DataVisualization-with-PowerBI

## Introduction

Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding numerical data. It can help users to identify patterns and trends that would be difficult to see in raw data. Power BI is a popular data visualization tool that provides a variety of features for creating interactive reports.

This project investigates the use of Power BI to visualize numerical data and identify trends. The goal of the project is to develop a method for generating interactive reports that can help business users make more informed decisions.

## Statement of the Problem

Many businesses collect large amounts of numerical data, but they may not have the tools or expertise to visualize this data in a way that is easy to understand. This can make it difficult to identify trends and patterns in the data, which can lead to poor decision making.

## Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to develop a method for generating interactive reports that can help business users make more informed decisions. The project will focus on using Power BI to visualize numerical data and identify trends.

## Proposed Methodology

The proposed methodology for this project is as follows:

1.	Clean the raw data using EDA methods and import into SQL database.

2.	Load cleaned numerical data from a SQL database into Power BI.

3.	Use Power BI's UI elements to generate interactive reports that can help business users identify trends and patterns.

4.	Test the reports with business users to ensure that they are easy to understand and use.

5.	Refine the reports based on feedback from business users.

## Expected results and its Implications

The expected results of this project are as follows:

•	A method for generating interactive reports that can help business users make more informed decisions.

•	A set of interactive reports that can be used by business users to visualize numerical data and identify trends.

The implications of this project are that business users will be able to make more informed decisions based on data visualization. This can lead to improved business performance.
